This repo is all about my Ops Challenges in Code Fellows 201.
The fundamental concept of a programming language is to manipulate, customize, and automate the facilities of an existing system. I am learning scripts because I want a deeper understanding of computer systems and applications to simplify identifying and exploiting weaknesses.

In Ops 201, my favorite assignment is challenge 13 because It is where I was able to demonstrate what I have learned in scripting.
